- Research how to help game for search engines
- Keep track of user's win percentage
    + use localStorage
    + keep variable for total number of games
    + keep variable for ongoing average
    + whenever new game is submitted, retrieve values, calculate/store new values
    + make tab for displaying personal statistics
